# angular-mongo-node
This is an app that connects with a mongo database through AngularJS. NodeJS is used on the backend


Description

This app is based on the " real-time polls application with Node.js, Express.js, AngularJS, and MongoDB" by Joe Lennon  (http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-nodejs-polling-app/).
It uses NodeJS on the backend to connect with mongo dababase, then sends the data to the frontend. On the frontend, the JSON API of AngularJS receives the data
from backend, and use controllers to send data to the views. The backend codes written in Node.js are wrapped in an Express.js framework
